Hello Designer,
 You can look at the configuration file in the Designer folder to change the game settings with ease.
 If you want to create a new one simply copy the game configuration scriptable object file or Right click on project folder and go to create -> configuration.
 Once you do that just replace the file in the GameManager with the older configuration file to take effect. Cheers!
